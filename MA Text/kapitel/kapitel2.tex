As stated in the \href{chapter:introduction}{introduction}, most routing algorithms focus on shortest paths between two or more points.
Many of those have been reviewed in several different surveys \cite{madkourSurveyShortestPathAlgorithms2017, sommerShortestpathQueriesStatic2014, wayahdiGreedyAStarDijkstra2021}.
Additionally, there have been many more heuristic approaches, like local search variants \cite{braysyVehicleRoutingProblem2005, irnichSequentialSearchIts2006, ropkeHeuristicExactAlgorithms2005} or different neighborhood based ideas \cite{braysyVehicleRoutingProblem2005, irnichSequentialSearchIts2006, ropkeHeuristicExactAlgorithms2005}.
Much research has been done and is still ongoing for these kinds of problems, which is only natural since many routing problems (for example the traveling salesman problem (TSP) \cite{gendreauHandbookMetaheuristics2010} or the vehicle routing problem \cite{braysyVehicleRoutingProblem2005, irnichSequentialSearchIts2006}) are NP-hard \cite{reineltTravelingSalesmanComputational2003}.

	The ability to create customizable roundtrips is crucial for many people who enjoy outdoor activities. 
	In this work, the \texttt{Touring Problem} is used to find good routes that adhere to user-preferences.
	Finding and creating good and customizable routes for various outdoor sports that are presented in a user-friendly application which works in real time is the key problem this thesis addresses.
	
	Much research has been done for shortest path problems and finding the quickest or fastest route, however, previous work lacked to address roundtrip paths.
	For these problems, a shortest or quickest route is not enough.
	Instead, a multitude of constraints has to be considered while trying to find a relatively good solution.
	
	In order to generate a user-friendly app that can compute roundtrips in real time for outdoor activities, an interface has been created.
	The web interface was structured to be easy to understand and use while simultaneously offering a good overview of all parameters for customization as well as all calculated tours.
	Additionally, different metaheuristics, i.e. Ant Colony and Simulated Annealing, have been implemented to solve the \texttt{Touring Problem}.
	
	The resulting application is easy to use and offers a selection of algorithms to calculate the desired tours.
	Several tests were conducted, which demonstrated that the metaheuristics return results that match the user's preferences.
	All algorithms can be configured to run in real time, yet an option to allow for longer run times exists.
	Thus, the app is user friendly and generates solution tours for the \texttt{Touring Problem} in real time.

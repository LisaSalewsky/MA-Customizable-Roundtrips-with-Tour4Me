The {CTPP} aims at ﬁnding a route with the highest possible score, in a directed graph, among those having a total length that does not exceed some given upper bound. The contributions of this paper are a new mathematical programming model for the {CTPP} and two solution methods for its solution. The ﬁrst is a branch-and-cut approach that is able to solve small problem instances to optimality and the second is a metaheuristic that solves {CTPP} and {AOP} instances of realistic size to near optimality in a few seconds.},

Swarm intelligence attempts to design algorithms or distributed problem solving devices inspired by the collective behaviour of social insect colonies and other animal societies. The idea of applying the natural paradigm of foraging ants to network routing problems has received much attention. The distributed nature of ant colonies and their ability to adapt when conditions change hold much promise for designing optimal routing algorithms in modern telecommunication networks. In this paper we present a simulation of an ant routing protocol which applies swarm intelligence to find optimal routes in {IP} networks. We investigate the efficiency of two versions of the algorithm in finding optimal routes. We analyze the properties of the multi-path routes discovered by the ant routing algorithms; we investigate how the ant routing algorithms respond to link failures and we investigate path discovery when two previously disconnected routing areas are connected.},

These algorithms have successfully been applied to solving many complex combinatorial optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, the vehicle routing problem, the problem of graph coloring, the quadratic assignment problem, the problem of network-traffic optimization, the job-shop scheduling problem, etc. The ant algorithms are especially efficient for online optimization of processes in distributed nonstationary systems (for example, telecommunication network routing).},

However, the special form of wireless network provide a frequently intermittent and constantly evolving connection among the {VANETs}, which may lead to the result that conventional routing protocols designed for mobile ad-hoc networks ({MANETs}) cannot work properly in some of these dynamic networks. Motivated by the urgent needs of frequently rerouting, quality-of-service ({QoS}) supporting and limited computational capabilities, we focus on the routing precomputation by making use of a foreseeable network topology under the circumstances of vehicles equipped with Global Position System ({GPS}) or rail transit network. In this paper, we present our study on designing a routing calculation and optimization strategies to adapt {VANETs} system. The novel routing strategies have a capability to rapidly response to the frequently change of network topology and ability of congestion avoidance and congestion controlling by a comprehensive employment of Evolving Graphs ({EG}) model and Ant Colony Optimization ({ACO}). Through the simulation, our proposed scheme significantly performs superior than the related protocols in the literature in term of end-to-end delay, routing reply ratio, route discovery time and delivery ratio.},

Sophisticated Branch-Cut-and-Price ({BCP}) algorithms for some of the most classical {VRP} variants now solve many instances with up to a few hundreds of customers. However, adapting and reimplementing those successful algorithms for other variants can be a very demanding task. This work proposes a {BCP} solver for a generic model that encompasses a wide class of {VRPs}. It incorporates the key elements found in the best recent {VRP} algorithms: ng-path relaxation, rank-1 cuts with limited memory, and route enumeration; all generalized through the new concept of “packing set”. This concept is also used to derive a new branch rule based on accumulated resource consumption and to generalize the Ryan and Foster branch rule. Extensive experiments on several variants show that the generic solver has an excellent overall performance, in many problems being better than the best existing specific algorithms. Even some non-{VRPs}, like bin packing, vector packing and generalized assignment, can be modeled and effectively solved.},

However, automated development platforms and {CAD} tools for these devices are far fewer than the physical synthesis tools for their digital counterparts. One of the major reasons for this is the considerably higher impact of interconnect parasitics on circuit functionality in the analog domain; therefore, performance metrics must be monitored closely. Our goal in this paper is to present a physical synthesis framework with a generic architecture specification interface and a parasitic extractor for verification of the synthesis results.

	abstract = {Cluster networks are seen as the future access networks for multimedia streaming, e-commerce, network storage, etc. For these applications, performance and high availability are particularly crucial. Regular topologies are preferred when performance is the primary concern. However, due to spatial constraints or fault-related issues, the network structure may become irregular, which makes more difficult to find deadlock-free minimal paths. Over the recent years, several solutions have been proposed. One of them is the {LASH} routing, which enables minimal routing by assigning paths to different virtual layers. In this paper, we propose an extension of {LASH} in order to reduce the number of required virtual layers by allowing transitions between virtual layers. Evaluation results show that the new routing scheme ({LASH}-{TOR}) is able to obtain full minimal routing with a reduced number of virtual channels. For torus and mesh networks, with only two virtual channels, {LASH} throughput is increased by an average factor of improvement of 3.30 for large networks. For regular networks with some unconnected (faulty) links, equal performance improvements are achieved. Even for highly irregular networks of size up to 128 switches the new routing scheme only needs three virtual channels for guaranteeing minimal routing. Besides, {LASH}-{TOR} performs well compared to dimension order routing for mesh and torus networks.},

	abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that cyclists choose their route differently to drivers of private vehicles. The route choice decision of commuter drivers is often modelled with one objective, to reduce their generalised travel cost, which is a monetary value representing the combined travel time and vehicle operating cost. Commuter cyclists, on the other hand, usually have multiple incommensurable objectives when choosing their route: the travel time and the suitability of a route. By suitability we mean non-subjective factors that characterise the suitability of a route for cycling, including safety, traffic volumes, traffic speeds, presence of bicycle lanes, whether the terrain is flat or hilly, etc. While these incommensurable objectives are difficult to be combined into a single objective, it is also important to take into account that each individual cyclist may prioritise differently between travel time and suitability when they choose a route. This paper proposes a novel model to determine the route choice set of commuter cyclists by formulating a bi-objective routing problem. The two objectives considered are travel time and suitability of a route for cycling. Rather than determining a single route for a cyclist, we determine a choice set of optimal alternative routes (efficient routes) from which a cyclist may select one according to their personal preference depending on their perception of travel time versus other route choice criteria considered in the suitability index. This method is then implemented in a case study in Auckland, New Zealand. The study provides a starting point for the trip assignment of cyclists, and with further research, the bi-objective routing model developed can be applied to create a complete travel demand forecast model for cycle trips. We also suggest the application of the developed methodology as an algorithm in an interactive route finder to suggest efficient route choices at different levels of suitability to cyclists and potential cyclists.},

	abstract = {In real-world problems related to finance, business, and management, mathematicians and economists frequently encounter optimization problems. In this classic book, George Dantzig looks at a wealth of examples and develops linear programming methods for their solutions. He begins by introducing the basic theory of linear inequalities and describes the powerful simplex method used to solve them. Treatments of the price concept, the transportation problem, and matrix methods are also given, and key mathematical concepts such as the properties of convex sets and linear vector spaces are covered. George Dantzig is properly acclaimed as the "father of linear programming." Linear programming is a mathematical technique used to optimize a situation. It can be used to minimize traffic congestion or to maximize the scheduling of airline flights. He formulated its basic theoretical model and discovered its underlying computational algorithm, the "simplex method," in a pathbreaking memorandum published by the United States Air Force in early 1948. Linear Programming and Extensions provides an extraordinary account of the subsequent development of his subject, including research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems. Dantzig first achieved success as a statistics graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. One day he arrived for a class after it had begun, and assumed the two problems on the board were assigned for homework. When he handed in the solutions, he apologized to his professor, Jerzy Neyman, for their being late but explained that he had found the problems harder than usual. About six weeks later, Neyman excitedly told Dantzig, "I've just written an introduction to one of your papers. Read it so I can send it out right away for publication." Dantzig had no idea what he was talking about. He later learned that the "homework" problems had in fact been two famous unsolved problems in statistics.},

The topic of finding a tour between a specified starting and ending location while minimizing one or multiple criteria is well covered in literature. In contrast to this, the route planning task in which a pleasant tour with length between a maximum and a minimum boundary needs to be found is relatively underexplored. In this paper, we provide a formal definition of this problem, taking into account the existing literature on which route attributes influence cyclists in their route choice. We show that the resulting problem is {NP}-hard and devise a branch-and-bound algorithm that is able to provide a bound on the quality of the best solution in pseudo-polynomial time. Furthermore, we also create an efficient heuristic to tackle the problem and we compare the quality of the solutions that are generated by the heuristic with the bounds provided by the branch-and-bound algorithm. Also, we thoroughly discuss the complexity and running time of the heuristic.},

For considering the runner’s specific background as well as needs, preferences and goals, a recommender cannot only rely on a set of existing routes ran by others. Instead, each route must be generated individually, taking into account many different aspects that determine whether a suggestion will satisfy the runner in the end, e.g. height meters or areas passed. We describe a framework that summarizes these aspects and present a prototypical smartphone app that we implemented to actually demonstrate how personalized running routes can be recommended based on the different requirements a runner might have.

To quantify the extent to which urban locations are pleasant, we use data from a crowd-sourcing platform that shows two street scenes in London (out of hundreds), and a user votes on which one looks more beautiful, quiet, and happy. We consider votes from more than 3.3K individuals and translate them into quantitative measures of location perceptions. We arrange those locations into a graph upon which we learn pleasant routes. Based on a quantitative validation, we ﬁnd that, compared to the shortest routes, the recommended ones add just a few extra walking minutes and are indeed perceived to be more beautiful, quiet, and happy. To test the generality of our approach, we consider Flickr metadata of more than 3.7M pictures in London and 1.3M in Boston, compute proxies for the crowdsourced beauty dimension (the one for which we have collected the most votes), and evaluate those proxies with 30 participants in London and 54 in Boston. These participants have not only rated our recommendations but have also carefully motivated their choices, providing insights for future work.},

For the automated computation of a scenic route in a trip-planning system to function, it is necessary to understand which attributes of a route and its surroundings are associated with attractive scenery. One way to find this information is with a route choice model framework, which requires a choice set of realistic paths for traveling a scenic route. This paper proposes a constrained enumeration type algorithm for computing scenic alternatives with a branch-and-bound approach and a labeling algorithm in combination with link elimination to generate a scenic route choice set. These algorithms use volunteered geographic information—shared, geo-tagged photos (photos to which geographical identification metadata have been added) from Panoramio—to generate path alternatives. The results show that the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm replicated observe travel behavior better than the traditional deterministic minimum cost–based algorithms in terms of overlap and consistency. In addition, for the proposed branch-and-bound method, the average number of scenic clusters was almost identical to that found along observed scenic routes; this method outperformed all other evaluated algorithms for this aspect.},

Furthermore, we prove that even if only adjacent arcs play a part in the quadratic objective function, the problem still cannot be approximated unless P={NP}. In order to solve the problem we first propose a mixed integer programming formulation, and then devise an efficient exact Branch-and-Bound algorithm for the general {QSPP}, where lower bounds are computed by considering a reformulation scheme that is solvable through a number of minimum cost flow problems.

	doi = {10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957951},
	abstract = {To properly account for a broad range of routechoice factors in bicycle route planning, a multi-criteria optimization framework is needed. Unfortunately, in contrast to other categories of routing problems, optimal multi-criteria search has not yet been developed for bicycle routing. In this paper, we address this gap and provide a multi-criteria formulation of the bicycle routing problem and an optimum multi-label correcting algorithm for finding a full set of Pareto routes. To reduce the potentially very large number of Pareto solutions, we introduce a route selection algorithm, based on hierarchical clustering, for extracting a small representative subset of Pareto routes. We empirically evaluate our approach on a real-world cycleway network. We explore the size and structure of the set of Pareto routes and demonstrate the capability of our method to generate a practical set of bicycle routes in realistic conditions.},

	abstract = {With increasing fuel costs, greater awareness of greenhouse gas emissions and increasing obesity levels, cycling is promoted as a health promoting and sustainable transport mode. We developed a cycling route planner (http://cyclevancouver.ubc.ca) for Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to facilitate cycling amongst the general public and to facilitate new route location by transportation planners. The geographical information system-based planner incorporates variables that influence choices to travel by bicycle (e.g., distance, elevation gain, safety, route features, air pollution and links to transit) in selecting the preferred routing. Using a familiar and user-friendly Google Maps interface, the planner allows individuals to seek optimized cycling routes throughout the region based on their own preferences. In addition to the incorporation of multiple user preferences in route selection, the planner is unique amongst cycling route planners in its use of topology to minimize data storage redundancy, its reliance on node/vertex index tables to increase efficiency of the route selection process, and the use of web services and asynchronous technologies for quick data delivery. Use of this tool can help promote bicycle travel as a form of active transportation and help lower greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ({CO}2) and air pollutant emissions by reducing car trips.},

Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies showed a clear positive relationship between cycling and cardiorespiratory fitness in youths. Prospective observational studies demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between commuter cycling and all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, and cancer morbidity among middle-aged to elderly subjects. Intervention studies among working-age adults indicated consistent improvements in cardiovascular fitness and some improvements in cardiovascular risk factors due to commuting cycling. Six studies showed a consistent positive dose–response gradient between the amount of cycling and the health benefits. Systematic assessment of the quality of the studies showed most of them to be of moderate to high quality. According to standard criteria used primarily for the assessment of clinical studies, the strength of this evidence was strong for fitness benefits, moderate for benefits in cardiovascular risk factors, and inconclusive for all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality, cancer risk, and overweight and obesity. While more intervention research is needed to build a solid knowledge base of the health benefits of cycling, the existing evidence reinforces the current efforts to promote cycling as an important contributor for better population health.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that regular physical activity is beneficial for cardiovascular health. Frequent exercise is robustly associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality as well as the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Physically active individuals have lower blood pressure, higher insulin sensitivity, and a more favorable plasma lipoprotein profile. Animal models of exercise show that repeated physical activity suppresses atherogenesis and increases the availability of vasodilatory mediators such as nitric oxide. Exercise has also been found to have beneficial effects on the heart. Acutely, exercise increases cardiac output and blood pressure, but individuals adapted to exercise show lower resting heart rate and cardiac hypertrophy. Both cardiac and vascular changes have been linked to a variety of changes in tissue metabolism and signaling, although our understanding of the contribution of the underlying mechanisms remains incomplete. Even though moderate levels of exercise have been found to be consistently associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk, there is evidence to suggest that continuously high levels of exercise (e.g., marathon running) could have detrimental effects on cardiovascular health. Nevertheless, a specific dose response relationship between the extent and duration of exercise and the reduction in cardiovascular disease risk and mortality remains unclear. Further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms that impart cardiovascular benefits of exercise in order to develop more effective exercise regimens, test the interaction of exercise with diet, and develop pharmacological interventions for those unwilling or unable to exercise.},

The second short section contemplates emerging molecular connections from endurance training to mental health. Finally, approximately half of the remaining review concentrates on the relationships between type 2 diabetes, mitochondria, and endurance training. It is now clear that physical training is complex biology, invoking polygenic interactions within cells, tissues/organs, systems, with remarkable cross talk occurring among the former list.},

In this review, we would like to postulate the idea that exercise can be considered as a drug. Exercise causes a myriad of beneficial effects for health, including the promotion of health and lifespan, and these are reviewed in the first section of this paper. Then we deal with the dosing of exercise. As with many drugs, dosing is extremely important to get the beneficial effects of exercise. To this end, the organism adapts to exercise. We review the molecular signalling pathways involved in these adaptations because understanding them is of great importance to be able to prescribe exercise in an appropriate manner. Special attention must be paid to the psychological effects of exercise. These are so powerful that we would like to propose that exercise may be considered as a psychoactive drug. In moderate doses, it causes very pronounced relaxing effects on the majority of the population, but some persons may even become addicted to exercise. Finally, there may be some contraindications to exercise that arise when people are severely ill, and these are described in the final section of the review. Our general conclusion is that exercise is so effective that it should be considered as a drug, but that more attention should be paid to the dosing and to individual variations between patients.},

One possible way to overcome this challenge is to expand the range of potential jogging partners by allowing for interaction with remote joggers. We investigated whether a jogging experience supporting conversation between remote partners could be desirable and motivating. We conducted an experiment with 18 volunteers using conventional mobile phones with headsets to support conversations as participants jogged in disjoint, outdoor areas. Results show that a simple audio connection supports participants’ need to socialize and allows partners to encourage each other.},

Positive changes were seen in all four measures of affect (p {\textless} .001). Multivariate regressions were performed to examine the contribution of four exercise characteristics (i.e., duration of the current run, weekly running time, weekly running distance, and running experience) to the observed changes in affect. The results have revealed that exercise characteristics accounted for only 14–30\% of the variance in the recreational runners’ affect, in both directions.

              point-to-point (approximate) shortest-path query problem
              , which is the following generalization of the classical
              single-source ({SSSP})
              and
              all-pairs shortest-path ({APSP})
              problems: we are first presented with a
              network (graph)
              . A so-called preprocessing algorithm may compute certain information
              (a data structure or index)
              to prepare for the next phase. After this preprocessing step, applications may ask shortest-path or distance queries, which should be answered as fast as possible.
            
            
              Due to its many applications in areas such as transportation, networking, and social science, this problem has been considered by researchers from various communities (sometimes under different names): algorithm engineers construct fast route planning methods; database and information systems researchers investigate
              materialization tradeoffs
              , query processing on
              spatial networks
              , and
              reachability queries
              ; and theoretical computer scientists analyze
              distance oracles
              and
              sparse spanners
              . Related problems are considered for
              compact routing

              distance labeling
              schemes in networking and distributed computing and for
              metric embeddings
              in geometry as well.
            
            In this survey, we review selected approaches, algorithms, and results on shortest-path queries from these fields, with the main focus lying on the tradeoff between the index size and the query time. We survey methods for general graphs as well as specialized methods for restricted graph classes, in particular for those classes with arguable practical significance such as planar graphs and complex networks.},

Other important dimensions of the taxonomy include whether the shortest-path algorithm operates over a static or a dynamic graph, whether the shortest-path algorithm produces exact or approximate answers, and whether the objective of the shortest-path algorithm is to achieve time-dependence or is to only be goal directed.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the Greedy, A-Star, and Dijkstra algorithms in the process of finding the shortest path. The author wants to compare the effectiveness of the three algorithms in the process of finding the shortest path in a path or graph. From the results of the research conducted, the author can conclude that the Greedy, A-Star, and Dijkstra algorithms can be a solution in determining the shortest path in a path or graph with different results. The Greedy algorithm is fast in finding solutions but tends not to find the optimal solution. While the A-Star algorithm tends to be better than the Greedy algorithm, but the path or graph must have complex data. Meanwhile, Dijkstra's algorithm in this case is better than the other two algorithms because it always gets optimal results.},

It is also the basis for modern metaheuristics, like, e.g., Tabu Search, and Variable Neighborhood Search. The paper introduces sequential search as a generic technique for the efficient exploration of local-search neighborhoods. One of its key concepts is the systematic decomposition of moves, which allows pruning within local search based on associated partial gains. The application of theoretical concepts to several well-known neighborhoods of the vehicle-routing problem ({VRP}) is demonstrated. Computational tests show substantial speedup factors, e.g., up to 10000 for the 3-opt* neighborhood. This underlines the superiority of sequential search over straightforward techniques in the {VRP} context.},

	abstract = {Cycling is not only improving the livability of cities, public health, air quality, or the {CO}2 balance, it also creates “hard economic value and jobs”. It is therefore a perfect tool for transition in the transport sector, providing a large number of assets, including jobs. Although the latter point is important to attract public authority consideration and investment in cycling, good information has hitherto been lacking. At regional or city level, some estimates of jobs in the cycling sector are available. At European level however, job figures have been quite scarce. This is the reason why {ECF}, in partnership with its Cycling Industry Club ({CIC}), asked {TML} to assess the jobs in the European cycling sector. {TML} assessed the number of jobs today and in the future, assuming a doubling in the modal share of cycling. It calculated full-time equivalent jobs in 5 subsectors:•bicycle retail (mainly sales and repair),•bicycle industry (manufacturing and wholesale),•bicycle infrastructure,•bicycle tourism (accommodation and restaurants),•bicycle services. For most sectors job figures linked to cycling were not directly available. {TML} therefore consulted literature, national studies on the subject, national accounts, used some proxies and did some statistical analysis to provide estimates of jobs in the cycling sector. The study found that more than 650,000 jobs are linked to cycling today in the {EU}-27 and more than 400,000 new ones could be created in the future with a doubling of cycling modal share. Other interesting findings concern the characteristics of these jobs. Cycling could, compared to other sectors, create:•more local jobs,•more jobs for lower skilled workers,•more jobs per euro spent. It could thus open an interesting window for opportunity for a transition to a more inclusive Europe. In 2015, {ECF} is producing another report on the economic benefits of cycling, more specifically regarding benefits which occur at the local level. Several studies have shown that, besides creating jobs, making cities more cycling-friendly has beneficial effects for e.g. the businesses of local retailers or for property value along traffic-calmed roads. {ECF}'s aim is to provide an overview of the results of the research done so far and identify areas where further investigation is needed. The paper summarises both reports in order to show how cycling as a mode of transport is a factor of economic growth and provides social benefits.},

	abstract = {Performance is a process of assessment of the algorithm. Speed and security is the performance to be achieved in determining which algorithm is better to use. In determining the optimum route, there are two algorithms that can be used for comparison. The Genetic and Primary algorithms are two very popular algorithms for determining the optimum route on the graph. Prim can minimize circuit to avoid connected loop. Prim will determine the best route based on active vertex. This algorithm is especially useful when applied in a minimum spanning tree case. Genetics works with probability properties. Genetics cannot determine which route has the maximum value. However, genetics can determine the overall optimum route based on appropriate parameters. Each algorithm can be used for the case of the shortest path, minimum spanning tree or traveling salesman problem. The Prim algorithm is superior to the speed of Genetics. The strength of the Genetic algorithm lies in the number of generations and population generated as well as the selection, crossover and mutation processes as the resultant support. The disadvantage of the Genetic algorithm is spending to much time to get the desired result. Overall, the Prim algorithm has better performance than Genetic especially for a large number of vertices.},

	abstract = {The optimization of the travel route for a round-trip is not only a customized demand made by a large number of independently guided tourists but also an essential practical issue for the development of tourism management and tourism businesses. In light of this, the study presents a genetic algorithm ({GA}) as a potential solution to the problem of how to visit a number of tourist destinations within a constrained area in order to quickly determine the shortest tourist route. To traverse areas or regions with the least amount of physical exertion, select the correct and shortest route. Examining all potential routes from the starting point to the destination will allow you to determine the quickest route. A condensed explanation of the enhanced {GA} is provided to start. The second step is to analyze the model’s construction and solution in detail. Next, an enhanced genetic algorithm ({IGA}) is utilized to determine the optimal travel route for visiting a variety of tourist attractions. In accordance with the optimal travel route, the required number of days and specific travel arrangements are then estimated. In conclusion, the {GA} is optimized, and a simulation examination of each individual’s average path convergence is conducted. The results of the experiments indicate that the {IGA} can be effectively applied to the path planning of multiple scenic locations, the selection of the shortest travel route, the reduction of travel expenses, and the saving of travel time. This has important implications for both research and practical applications, as well as a high research significance and practical value.},

Carsharing helps to ease traffic congestion and reduce city pollution. To be efficient, carsharing fleet vehicles need to be located on city streets in high population density areas and considering demographics, parking restrictions, traffic and other relevant information in the area to satisfy travel demand. This work proposes to formulate the initial placement of a fleet of cars for a round-trip carsharing service as a multi-objective optimization problem. The performance of state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms, namely, {SPEA}2, {NSGA}-{II}, and {NSGA}-{III}, on this problem is evaluated on a novel benchmark composed of synthetic and real-world instances built from real demographic data and street network. Inverted generational distance ({IGD}), spread and hypervolume metrics are used to compare the algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that {NSGA}-{II} yields significantly lower {IGD} and higher hypervolume than the rest and {SPEA}2 has a significantly better diversity if compared with {NSGA}-{II} and {NSGA}-{III}.},

Especially applications following the peer-to-peer paradigm suffer from the existence of {NAT}. Various {NAT} Traversal methods emerged in research and standardization, but none of them can claim to be a general solution working in the heterogeneous environment of today's networks. This paper introduces the Advanced {NAT} Traversal Service ({ANTS}), a framework improving the communication of existing and future applications across {NAT} devices. The core idea of {ANTS} is to use previously acquired knowledge about {NAT} behavior and services for setting up new connections. We introduce the architecture of the extensible framework and propose a signaling protocol for the coordination of distributed instances. Finally, we compare the framework to {ICE} showing that {ANTS} is not only more flexible, but also faster due to the decoupled connectivity checks.},

The article aims to minimize total costs such as establishing inventory, uncovered demand’s penalty, and transportation costs. While many articles in this area only use exact methods to solve the problem, this article uses a metaheuristic algorithm, the red deer algorithm, and the exact methods. Various numerical examples have shown the outstanding performance of the red deer algorithm compared to exact methods.

	abstract = {Diese Dissertation behandelt verschiedene generalisierte Netzwerkdesignprobleme ({NDPs}), die zu den {NP}-harten kombinatorischen Optimierungsproblemen gehören. Im Gegensatz zu klassischen {NDPs} sind die generalisierten Versionen auf Graphen definiert, deren Knotenmengen in Clustern aufgeteilt sind. Das Ziel besteht darin, jeweils einen Subgraphen zu finden, der genau einen Knoten pro Cluster enthält und weitere Nebenbedingungen erfüllt.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Methoden, die zum Lösen von kombinatorischen Optimierungsproblemen eingesetzt werden, können grob in zwei Hauptrichtungen eingeteilt werden. Die erste Klasse besteht aus Algorithmen, die diese Probleme beweisbar optimal lösen können, sofern ihnen ausreichend viel Zeit und Speicher zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Diese Arbeit beginnt mit einer kurzen Einführung in die Techniken der linearen und ganzzahlig linearen Programmierung. Sie bilden die Basis für populäre Algorithmen wie Branch-and-Bound, Branch-and-Cut und viele weitere. Die zweite Klasse besteht aus Metaheuristiken, die zwar Näherungslösungen erzeugen, aber wesentlich weniger Zeit benötigen. Wenn beide Klassen miteinander kombiniert werden, entstehen hybride Algorithmen, die von den Vorteilen beider Richtungen profitieren können. Einige der vielfältigen Kombinationsmöglichkeiten werden untersucht und auf {NDPs} in dieser Arbeit angewandt.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Das erste Problem, das betrachtet wird, ist das generalisierte minimale Spannbaumproblem. Gegeben ist ein Graph, dessen Knoten in Clustern partitioniert sind. Wir suchen nach einem minimalen Spannbaum, der genau einen Knoten pro Cluster verbindet. Ein Ansatz basierend auf variabler Nachbarschaftssuche ({VNS}) wird vorgestellt, der drei verschiedene Nachbarschaftstypen verwendet. Zwei davon arbeiten komplementär, um die Effizienz bei der Suche zu erhöhen. Beide  enthalten exponentiell viele Lösungen, aber effektive Algorithmen werden eingesetzt, die die jeweils besten Nachbarlösungen in polynomieller Zeit finden. Für die dritte Nachbarschaft wird ganzzahlige lineare Programmierung verwendet, um Teilbereiche einer Lösung zu optimieren.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Als nächstes betrachten wir das generalisierte Handlungsreisendenproblem ({GTSP}). Ausgehend von einem geclusteten Graphen suchen wir eine Rundreise minimaler Länge, die von jedem Cluster einen Knoten besucht.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Ein {VNS} Algorithmus basierend auf zwei Nachbarschaftsstrukturen wird vorgestellt. Eine davon ist die bereits bekannte generalisierte 2-opt Nachbarschaft, für die eine neue inkrementelle Auswertungstechnik entworfen wird, die den Suchvorgang wesentlich beschleunigt. Die zweite Nachbarschaft basiert auf dem Austauschen von den in der Lösung vorkommenden Knoten, auf die anschließend die verkettete Lin-Kernighan Heuristik angewendet wird.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Als ein zum {GTSP} verwandtes Problem untersuchen wir das Eisenbahn-Handlungsreisendenproblem ({RTSP}). Gegeben ist ein Fahrplan und ein Geschäftsmann, der eine Anzahl von Städten per Bahn besuchen muss, um Aufträge zu erledigen. Die Reise startet und endet an einem bestimmten Ort und die dafür benötigte Gesamtzeit, inklusive den Wartezeiten, soll minimiert werden. Es werden zwei Transformationen präsentiert, die das Problem als asymmetrisches oder symmetrisches Handlungsreisendenproblem ({TSP}) umformulieren. Damit können für das {RTSP} bewährte Techniken eingesetzt werden, die für das klassische {TSP} konzipiert sind.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Schließlich wird das Problem des generalisierten minimalen kantenzweizusammenhängenden Netzwerks betrachtet. Ausgehend von einem geclusteten Graphen wird ein Subgraph gesucht, der genau einen Knoten pro Cluster kantenzweizusammenhängend verbindet, d.h.  zwischen je zwei Knoten müssen mindestens zwei kantendisjunkte Wege existieren. Wir betrachten drei {VNS} Varianten, die mit unterschiedlichen Nachbarschaftsstrukturen arbeiten. Jede adressiert bestimmte Teilaspekte wie die verbundenen Knoten und/oder die Kanten zwischen ihnen. Für komplexere Nachbarschaften werden effiziente Techniken wie Graphreduktion eingesetzt, die den Optimierungsvorgang wesentlich beschleunigen. Für Vergleichszwecke wird eine Formulierung als ganzzahliges lineares Programm entworfen, mit der kleine Instanzen beweisbar optimal gelöst werden können.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Experimentelle Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die grundlegende Strategie, komplementäre Nachbarschaftsstrukturen zu kombinieren, beim Lösen von generalisierten {NDPs} sehr erfolgreich ist. Insbesondere wird festgehalten, dass jede Nachbarschaftsstruktur signifikante Beiträge zum Optimierungsvorgang leistet.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This paper addresses a bi-modal multi-objective discrete urban road network design problem with automobile and bus flow interaction. The problem considers the concurrent urban road and bus network design in which the authorities play a major role in designing bus network topology. The road network design deals with the decision making for new street constructions, lane additions to existing streets, lane allocations for two-way streets, and the orientations and locations of one-way streets. The bus network design is performed by keeping the terminal stations of the existing bus lines unchanged and redesigning the forth and back routes of each line. Four measures, namely user benefit, the demand coverage of the bus network, the demand share of the bus mode, and the average travel generalized cost of bus passengers, are used to evaluate the network design scenarios. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model in which a modal-split/assignment model is included to depict the mode and route choice behaviors of travelers. The model is solved by the hybrid genetic algorithm and the hybrid clonal selection algorithm. The performance of these algorithms is presented and investigated by solving a number of test networks.},

	abstract = {An analogy with the way ant colonies function has suggested the definition of a new computational paradigm, which we call Ant System. We propose it as a viable new approach to stochastic combinatorial optimization. The main characteristics of this model are positivefeedback,distributedcomputation,and the use of a constructivegreedy heuristic.Positive feedback accounts for rapid discovery of good solutions, distributed computation avoids premature convergence, and the greedy heuristic helps find acceptable solutions in the early stages of the search process. We apply the proposed methodology to the classical Traveling Salesman Problem ({TSP}), and report simulation results. We also discuss parameter selection and the early setups of the model, and compare it with tabu search and simulated annealing using {TSP}. To demonstrate the robustness of the approach, we show how the Ant System ({AS}) can be applied to other optimization problems like the asymmetric traveling salesman, the quadratic assignment and the job-shop scheduling. Finally we discuss the salient characteristics-global data structure revision,distributed communication and probabilistic transitions of the {AS}.},
